Limelight
=========

"Limelight" is the codename for the proof-of-concept frontend app for exposing 
data and visualisations from data exported by the Performance Platform's API.

Starting Limelight with stub data
---------------------------------

Set these two environment variables: `USE_API_STUB=TRUE BACKDROP_URL=//fakeapi`. 
Start limelight using `bowl limelight` or `rails s`.
If you use the latter you will need to set up [slimmer](https://github.com/alphagov/slimmer) yourself.
