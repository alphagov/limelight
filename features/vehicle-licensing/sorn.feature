Feature: SORN dashboard
  As a service manager
  I want to measure my service
  So that I can take data driven decisions

   Scenario: looking at the SORN error codes module
     Given The vehicle-licensing failures bucket returns the response in "vehicle_licensing_failures.json"
     When I go to /performance/sorn
     Then I should see the module "Error codes (web)"
      And the module should contain a table

  Scenario: looking up the sorn availability module
    Given The register-sorn-statutory-off-road-notification monitoring bucket returns the response in "availability.json"
    When I go to /performance/sorn
    Then I should see the module "Service availability"
     And the module should display an uptime of 85.0%
     And the module should display a response time of 150ms

  Scenario Outline: Navigating to related pages
    Given The vehicle-licensing channels bucket returns the response in "vehicle_licensing_channels.json"
    When I go to /performance/sorn
     And I click on "<Title>"
    Then I should get back a status of 200
     And I should be at <Path>
     And the page title should be "<Title>"
    
    Examples:
      | Title              | Path                           |
      | Tax disc           | /performance/tax-disc          |
      | Vehicle licensing  | /performance/vehicle-licensing |
