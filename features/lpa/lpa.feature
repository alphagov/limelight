Feature: uptime and response time for lpa dashboard
  As a service manager
  I want to know the availability of my service
  So that I can better interpret usage data

  Scenario: looking up the uptime
    Given The lasting-power-of-attorney monitoring bucket returns the response in "availability.json"
    When I go to /performance/lasting-power-of-attorney
    Then the uptime module should display 85%

  Scenario: looking up the response time
    Given The lasting-power-of-attorney monitoring bucket returns the response in "availability.json"
    When I go to /performance/lasting-power-of-attorney
    Then the response time module should display 150ms

  Scenario: conversion funnel
    Given The lpa journey bucket returns the response in "lpa_journey.json"
    When I go to /performance/lasting-power-of-attorney
    Then I should see the module "Conversion funnel"
    And the module should contain a graph
