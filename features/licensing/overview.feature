Feature: Overview page
  As a user
  I want to visit the licensing overview page
  So I can see summary data and navigate to other pages

  Scenario: visiting overview page using an SVG browser
       When I go to /performance/licensing
       Then I should get back a status of 200
        And the category title should be "Services"
        And the category title should link to "/performance/services"
        And the page title should be "Licensing performance (licences and authorities on GOV.UK only)"
