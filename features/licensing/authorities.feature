Feature: Listing authorities
  As a user
  I want to see a list of authorities
  So I can navigate to individual authorities

  Scenario: there are two authorities
    Given API responds with authorities.json
    When I go to /performance/licensing/authorities
    Then I should get back a status of 200
    And the navigation link for "Authorities" should be active
    And there should be 4 authorities
    And the page title should be "Authorities (authorities on GOV.UK only)"
    And the "authorities" count should be 4
    And the 1st group title should be "C"
    And the 2nd group title should be "F"
    And the 1st title in the 1st group should be "City of London"
    And the 1st title in the 2nd group should be "City of Fake authority"
    And the 2nd title in the 2nd group should be "Fake authority 1"
    And the 2nd link in the 2nd group should be "/performance/licensing/authorities/fake-authority-1"
    And the 3rd title in the 2nd group should be "Fake authority 2"
