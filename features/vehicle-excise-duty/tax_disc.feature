Feature: Tax disc dashboard
  As a service manager
  I want to measure my service
  So that I can take data driven decisions

  Scenario: looking at the tax disc failures module
    Given The vehicle-licensing failures bucket returns the response in "vehicle_licensing_failures.json"
    When I go to /performance/tax-disc
    Then I should see the module "Tax disc application failures"
     And the module should contain a table

  Scenario: looking up the tax disc availability module
    Given The tax-disc monitoring bucket returns the response in "availability.json"
    When I go to /performance/tax-disc
    Then I should see the module "Tax disc service availability"
     And the module should display an uptime of 85.0%
     And the module should display a response time of 150ms

  Scenario: Navigating to related pages
    Given I am on this page
    Then I should be able to navigate to related pages
